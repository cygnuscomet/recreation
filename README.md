This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Approach
My approach to the task involved looking at the website pages that I was supposed to recreate; analyzing the structure to understand where to include grids or flexes; understanding the typography and suchlike. After this, I downloaded the necessary assets to get started with the copy - favicons, icons, images, etc. I also got the font that the website used throughout, and also used some tools on my PC to get the correct colors for many things. 

# Modifications

I would have introduced more modifications if I had the complete time allocated to us. However, I have done these things:

- I have changed the blue color to a more dark gray variant because it seemed to go better with the text.
- If you were to look closely at the buttons the website has, you will notice that the buttons have an outline which doesn't complement the look at all. I have removed these.
- I also changed the "steps to use ioni" part to show all the steps right there. Whilst the interactivity does allow for a nice website, the user experience lies in getting the information right there. I could also recreate 
- The dropdown menus to the things in the navbar were too big with a lot of padding and things. It didn't look that great. I have modified that as well.

# Specific details pertaining to this recreation
- I'd like the judges to know that I couldn't use all of the time allocated to us due to personal complications on the first day. As can be seen from the commit history, I managed to finish most of it within 8 hours.
- If I had more time, I'd devote it to these tasks:
  - Making the pages responsive to support different devices better.
  - Devoting more time to a dark color scheme
  - Modularizing the code: Right now it's a lot of divs here and there. I'd rather make components out of each of them with appropriate parameters and flags and include those instead. I have done this for some components which should demonstrate my ability to do so without much hassle.
  - Working on the navbar a bit more. I was in a bit of a hurry when I worked on the navigation menu, and whilst it still mimics the original layout, I'd like to propose different modifications
